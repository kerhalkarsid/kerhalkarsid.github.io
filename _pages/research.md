<p>Besides my own research, I regularly help my advisor (Prof Tandon) by serving as primary mentors for undergraduate students in the lab majoring in Physics and Mechanical Engineering at UMass Dartmouth. Following are the list of students:\
<ol>
<li> Nicholas Monroe (BS, Mechanical Engineering '23): Nick is working on his undergradute honors thesis in Tandon Lab since June 2022. His thesis focuses on intercomparing parameters of air-sea interaction from reanalysis products to observations in the Arabian Sea, with a goal to quantify the biases. </li>
<li> Ersen'S Joseph (BS, Mechanical Engineering '22): Ersen'S worked as a part of Undergraduate Research Internship Program, UMassD (from January-December 2021) as well as UMassD-WHOI-Blue Economy Internship (from January-May 2022). His project involved analyzing RAMA mooring data in the Bay of Bengal, developing a numerical particle tracking model and comparing with observed particle motion in open ocean as well as using powerful computation resources to analyze remote sensing datasets in order to uncover the seasonality in the Bay of Bengal. </li>
