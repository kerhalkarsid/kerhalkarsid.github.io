Diurnal Warm Layers (DWLs) play a crucial role in atmosphere-ocean interactions, particularly under conditions of low wind speeds and high solar radiation. While their general formation mechanisms are well-documented, the spatial variability of these layers, especially in freshwater-influenced regions like the Bay of Bengal, remains less explored. First chapter of my PhD thesis addresses this gap by using two drifting meteorological buoys with profiling instruments during the MISO-BoB field campaign to observe lateral gradients in DWL evolution across approximately 30 km. Over a period of three days, the observations revealed notable lateral differences in subsurface heat content and DWL development, driven by variations in wind speeds, background stratification, and mesoscale processes.

On one particular day, wind and stratification differences led to nearly a 28% disparity in upper-ocean heat content across the buoys, with subsurface turbulent heat fluxes differing by approximately 200 W/mÂ². These gradients were primarily influenced by enhanced stratification resulting from a cold pool event and mesoscale advection. The enhanced stratification also amplified shear production at the base of the DWL by a factor of 2.5. These findings underscore the significant impact of lateral variability on DWL formation and evolution, highlighting the need for better representation of such variability in models, especially in regions with strong salinity gradients like the Bay of Bengal. Improving the resolution or parameterization of DWL variability could enhance the accuracy of atmosphere-ocean coupling in weather prediction models.

Based on the above results, the next chapter uses 1-D GOTM simulations to explore the parameter space of salinity stratification and the mixed layer depth on diurnal cycles of SST and longer-term baseline changes in SST. The motivation of this is that such DWLs are frequently observed during the pre-monsoon heating phase in the Northern Indian ocean's mini-warm pool, and there is still uncertainty about how stratification affects the diurnal cycles of sea surface temperatures (SST) and long-term heating rates during this period. Our results shows that salinity stratification has a weaker influence on diurnal SST variability compared to winds or cloudiness. However, over intra-seasonal timescales, salinity stratification can create lateral gradients in SSTs, potentially enhancing or compensating for horizontal density differences.

Cold wakes generated by tropical cyclones significantly enhance ocean productivity and influence local air-sea interactions, impacting the paths and intensities of future storms. However, in-situ observations of recovery processes within these wakes are rare. In 2023, a cold wake in the Arabian Sea, formed after Cyclone Biparjoy, was surveyed during our EKAMSAT fieldwork using multiple shipboard instruments approximately 10 days after the storm's passage. The wake exhibited an asymmetrical structure, with a stronger buoyancy gradient at its eastern edge and a weaker one at its western edge. This also resulted in differential vertical temperature, salinity, and velocity structures along the wake's edges.

Although the recovery of cold wakes is often attributed to one-dimensional diurnal heating and cooling processes, these observations highlight the importance of three-dimensional submesoscale dynamics, driven by the coupling of monsoon winds and submesoscale fronts. These interactions accelerate the recovery process by promoting restratification at the western edge of the wake and altering mixed layer dynamics. The rapid recovery observed in this case, occurring in just 8 days, contrasts with longer recovery times predicted by one-dimensional models, emphasizing the critical role of submesoscale processes in modulating the wake's evolution and influencing future atmospheric conditions.
