Diurnal Warm Layers (DWLs) play a crucial role in atmosphere-ocean interactions, particularly under conditions of low wind speeds and high solar radiation. While their general formation mechanisms are well-documented, the spatial variability of these layers, especially in freshwater-influenced regions like the Bay of Bengal, remains less explored. First chapter of my PhD thesis addresses this gap by using two drifting meteorological buoys with profiling instruments during the MISO-BoB field campaign to observe lateral gradients in DWL evolution across approximately 30 km. Over a period of three days, the observations revealed notable lateral differences in subsurface heat content and DWL development, driven by variations in wind speeds, background stratification, and mesoscale processes.

On one particular day, wind and stratification differences led to nearly a 28% disparity in upper-ocean heat content across the buoys, with subsurface turbulent heat fluxes differing by approximately 200 W/mÂ². These gradients were primarily influenced by enhanced stratification resulting from a cold pool event and mesoscale advection. The enhanced stratification also amplified shear production at the base of the DWL by a factor of 2.5. These findings underscore the significant impact of lateral variability on DWL formation and evolution, highlighting the need for better representation of such variability in models, especially in regions with strong salinity gradients like the Bay of Bengal. Improving the resolution or parameterization of DWL variability could enhance the accuracy of atmosphere-ocean coupling in weather prediction models.
