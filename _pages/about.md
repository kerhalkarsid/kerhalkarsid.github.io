I am a sea-going oceanographer working as a PhD candidate at [School for Marine Sciences and Technology](https://www.umassd.edu/smast/) at University of Massachusetts Dartmouth (UMassD). I am a [Distinguished Doctoral Fellowship](https://www.umassd.edu/graduate/fellowships--funding/distinguished-doctoral-fellowships/) awardee from the University (2019-20,2021-2024) under the supervision of Prof. Amit Tandon. I primarily study upper ocean processes and air-sea interaction at smaller length and time scales, with the aim of understanding how these processes influence larger-scale oceanic and atmospheric systems. For my PhD dissertation, I focus on the Diurnal Warm Layers in the Bay of Bengal, which evolves over a day and has potential implications on small scale ocean mixing, daily atmospheric convection and larger scale atmosphere processes like the Indian Summer Monsoons using in-situ observations, remote sensing and 1-D and 3-D numerical ocean modeling. Additionally, I have a keen interest in hurricanes/tropical cyclones, and I was fortunate to study the role of small-scale processes in the recovery of a cold-wake due to cyclone Biparjoy in 2023. For more on my research, please see my [research](https://kerhalkarsid.github.io/research/) page. Prior to my graduate school experience here, I pursued my undergraduate in [Indian Institute of Technology, Bhubaneswar, India](www.iitbbs.ac.in), majoring in mechanical engineering.

Academic motivation
======
I spent my childhood in Visakhapatnam, a city located in the East Coast of India and thus I have always been curious about ocean dynamics, tropical cyclones, Indian summer monsoons and ocean-atmosphere exchanges. As a mechanical engineering undergraduate student and learning core concepts like advanced engineering math, fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, heat transfer etc, I stumbled upon the course "Introduction to Ocean Dynamics". This was followed by "Fundamentals of Weather and Climate" which re-ignited my curiosity towards oceans and atmosphere. My fascination for such phenomenon coupled with a desire to make meaningful contributions to the society ensured that I first pursued a summer fellowship at [Indian National Center for Ocean Information Services, Hyderabad](https://incois.gov.in/), following which I applied for my current position as a PhD candidate in [Tandon labs](https://tandonlab.sites.umassd.edu/). After five years as a graduate student, including 97 days at sea, I remain as motivated as ever—if not more so—to continue contributing to this important field.
