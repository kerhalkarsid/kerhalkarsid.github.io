I have spent a total of 97 days at sea, performing fieldwork for either projects that I was directly associated with, or volunteered to gain valuable experience.

- **Enhancing Knowledge of the Arabian Sea Marine environment through Science and Advanced Training (EKAMSAT-ASTraL) IOP cruise in the Bay of Bengal** on *R/V Thomas G Thompson*, May-June 2024. *Chief Scientist: Dr Leah Johnson*. Major responsibilities included being part of Fast-CTD watch team, processing WaMoS data and co-ordinating a waves working group (Office of Naval Research).

- **Enhancing Knowledge of the Arabian Sea Marine environment through Science and Advanced Training (EKAMSAT-ASTraL) Pilot cruise** on *R/V Roger Revelle*, June 2023. *Chief Scientist: Dr Craig Lee*. Major responsibilities included being part of the uCTD watch team and processing ship MET, TSG, WaMoS data (Office of Naval Research).

- **Studying the Oxygen Deficient Zones in the Eastern Tropical North Pacific (along the coasts of Baja California, Mexico)** on *R/V Sally Ride*, December 2020. *Chief Scientist: Dr Mark Altabet*. Major responsibilities included collecting water samples, deploying CTD casts, process CTD data and shore support using remote sensing to study N-loss in ODZs (National Science Foundation)

- **Monsoon Intraseasonal Oscillations in the Bay of Bengal (MISO-BoB)** on *R/V Sally Ride*, July-August 2019. *Chief Scientist: Dr Emily Shroyer*. Major responsibilities included being part of Fast-CTD Deployment, Watch and Recovery Team (Office of Naval Research).

- **Training Cruise, Introduction to Physical Oceanography, UMass Dartmouth** on *R/V Lucky Lady*, October 2019. *Chief Scientist: Profs. Miles Sundermeyer, Geoff Cowles*. This was a training cruise for first year graduate students in Physical Oceanography, where collecting water samples and deploying CTDs was taught.
